title: Fix load_dotenv Bug
summary_bullets:
- Identified and fixed bug in load_dotenv() where empty environment variables blocked
  loading of ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from .env file
- Implemented logic to override empty values during environment variable loading
- 3-Tier Summary Engine now functioning correctly with Claude Haiku as primary engine
- Environment variable handling improved to prevent empty string conflicts
decisions:
- Use Claude Haiku as primary engine for 3-Tier Summary Engine
- Override empty environment variables instead of skipping them
next_steps:
- Test load_dotenv() fix across different .env configurations
- Validate 3-Tier Summary Engine performance with Claude Haiku
- Document environment variable handling behavior
