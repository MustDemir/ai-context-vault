title: Artifact Construction + Deep Research + Prof-Meeting
summary_bullets:
- Finalized Artifact_Construction_v2.png (B/W, 4-pillar diagram, 15-22pt Times New
  Roman, 2x resolution) and editable SVG source
- Completed 3-source verification protocol (Exposé ↔ Diagram ↔ USPs) achieving 100%
  consistency
- 'Deep research verified 16 tool claims: OPA (CNCF Graduated 2021, 485 contributors),
  ArgoCD (60% K8s adoption), DeepEval v3.8.4, Sigstore/SLSA, in-toto (CNCF Graduated
  Apr 2025)'
- '4-pillar methods framework mapped: S1 Architecture Design, S2 Quality-Gate-Framework
  (USP1), S3 Pipeline Integration, S4 Compliance Operationalization (USP2/5/6)'
- Created KI-Fabrik-Analogie diagram and Schlachtplan_ProfGespraech.pdf handout for
  25.02.2026 meeting
- 'Replaced v1 artifacts: Methoden_Framework.png and Artifact_Construction_BW.png
  superseded by enhanced v2 versions'
- 'Identified open points: diagram APA7 citation for Exposé, Azure AI Eval SDK integration
  clarity, professor meeting preparation complete'
decisions:
- Adopt 4-pillar structure as primary framework for GenAIOps methodology
- Map all 6 USPs to specific pillars (S2 and S4 contain primary innovations)
- Use KI-Fabrik-Analogie as communication tool for professor discussion
- Maintain B/W diagram for formal documentation, color versions for presentations
next_steps:
- Resolve Exposé diagram citation format (APA7 requirements)
- Clarify Azure AI Eval SDK positioning in diagram vs. Exposé text
- Conduct professor meeting 25.02.2026 with prepared handout and analogies
- Incorporate feedback into final Masterarbeit version
