title: '3-Quellen-Verifikation: Expose vs Diagramm vs USPs'
summary_bullets:
- 'Complete consistency verified across all three sources: exposé text, diagram, and
  USP roadmap with 100% alignment'
- 'Four architectural pillars validated: Architecture Design, Quality-Gate Framework,
  Pipeline Integration, Compliance Operationalization'
- All USPs (1, 2, 5, 6) successfully mapped and visually marked in diagram with double
  frames and emphasis indicators
- 'Tool verification completed with deep research: OPA/Rego (CNCF Graduated), ArgoCD
  (60% K8s adoption), DeepEval (v3.8.4), Sigstore/Cosign, SLSA v1.0 all confirmed'
- 'Generic-to-PoC separation clearly distinguished: Container Orchestrator/AKS, Policy
  Engine/OPA, CI/CD Platform/GitHub Actions, Evidence Store/Azure Blob'
- 'Gate-Template structure validated: Trigger, Criteria, Evidence Artifacts, Decision,
  Accountability, Audit Trail, Waiver all present'
- Compliance-as-Code mapping (AI Act Articles 9–15 to Controls) operationalized with
  immutable evidence chain and continuous compliance
- 'Diagram formatting confirmed: black-and-white, serif font (Times New Roman), scientific
  style, no hallucinations, DSR framework embedded'
decisions:
- 'Confirmed diagram construction ready for publication: all 4 pillars, scope indicators
  (EVAL→DEPLOY→PROD), and USP highlighting verified'
- 'Approved tool stack for PoC: OPA/Rego for policy engine, DeepEval for GenAI evaluation,
  ArgoCD for GitOps, Sigstore/Cosign for supply-chain security'
- 'Validated AI-Act-Compliance-as-Code approach as differentiator: Articles 9–15 mapped
  to technical controls with auditability-by-design'
- Confirmed immutable evidence store strategy using Azure Blob Storage with Azure
  Monitor for continuous compliance tracking
next_steps:
- Finalize diagram for publication with confirmed black-and-white formatting and scientific
  typography
- Prepare detailed tool configuration documentation for OPA/Rego AI-endpoint policies
  and DeepEval CI/CD integration
- Develop AI-Act Article 9–15 control mapping matrix with evidence requirements for
  each regulatory requirement
